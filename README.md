# GTEngine
## _OpenGL(GLES2.0) game engine written in C_

This project is in its really early stages, if you're looking for something that works, good luck :)
GTEngine is written entirely C, but it can also compile and link C++

## What works
- Loading models

## Building
At the moment Windows/Wine build is not supported

Install [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) and [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)

```
git clone https://github.com/michaelskyf/GTEngine.git
cd GTEngine
make
make run #test, debug
```
